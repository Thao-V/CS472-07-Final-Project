## Requirements
1. The systems will generate several users at the beginning
2. A user can log in using a username or password on the `login` page
3. After logging in successfully, this user can see the home page, which satisfies the following requirements.
* This page shows this user's information, like name and phone.
* This user can use different buttons to switch between Products, Cart, or Orders. By default, the products will be displayed. The selected button should be highlighted.
* Products: Display all available products. Each product has a button to add to the cart. When clicking this button, please provide a way to let users enter the number of the selected product.
* Cart: Display all selected products and a button to check out. If clicking this button, all information from this card will be sent to the server and the cart will be empty.
* Orders: Show all existing orders that the current users do
* The app should have a button, `logout`. When users click this button, it will go to the login page.
4. Implement a signup page for users to register their accounts. After signing up successfully, this website will redirect to the `login` page. Please provide a button `signup` on the login page. When users click this button, the website redirects to the signup page.
5. Provide a way to save the `cart` into the browser by using `localstorage`. This information will be loaded again when this user logs in successfully.
6. Please encrypt the password before saving it to files or databases.
